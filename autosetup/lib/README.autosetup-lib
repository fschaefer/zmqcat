Files in this directory are optional modules which
can be loaded with the 'use' directive.

Modules which are publically documented (@MODULE ...) are installed
stand-alone in order to facilitate understanding by autosetup
end-users.

All other modules are private/internal and are combined with the
main script when installed.
